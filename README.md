# Human Activity Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing human physical activities using machine learning techniques applied to sensor data. The analysis is done using a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📁 File Included

- `Recognition_of_human_activity (2).ipynb`: A notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps for activity recognition.

## 📌 Key Features

- Data visualization and preprocessing
- Machine learning model training
- Evaluation metrics and analysis
- Human activity classification

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, or others used in the notebook)
- Data normalization and feature extraction
- Confusion matrix and accuracy metrics

## 📊 Dataset

> (Add a short description of the dataset used, e.g., source, number of activities, format...)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Habibawally/HumanActivityRecognition.git
   cd HumanActivityRecognition
